# Car vs. Bike Classification

## Overview  
The **Car vs. Bike Classification** project is a machine learning model designed to classify images of vehicles as either "Car" or "Bike." This project uses the **ResNet-18** deep learning model for image classification. The model was trained using a dataset containing 4000 images of cars and bikes.

## Features  
- **Image Classification**:  
  - Classify images as either "Car" or "Bike" with high accuracy.

- **Pre-trained Model**:  
  - Utilizes **ResNet-18**, a powerful Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, for image classification.

- **TensorFlow and PyTorch**:  
  - The model is implemented using **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**, two popular deep learning frameworks.

- **Dataset**:  
  - The dataset consists of 4000 images, evenly split between cars and bikes.

## Technologies Used  
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**:  
  - TensorFlow  
  - PyTorch  

- **Model Architecture**:  
  - ResNet-18  

- **Data Processing**:  
  - Image preprocessing and augmentation techniques.

- **Libraries**:  
  - NumPy  
  - Matplotlib  
  - OpenCV
